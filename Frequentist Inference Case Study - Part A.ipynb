    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

    "In this section, you've been introduced to the scipy.stats package and used it to draw a small sample from the standard normal distribution. You've calculated the average (the mean) of this sample and seen that this is not exactly equal to the expected population parameter (which we know because we're generating the random variates from a specific, known distribution). You've been introduced to two ways of calculating the standard deviation; one uses $n$ in the denominator and the other uses $n-1$ (Bessel's correction). You've also seen which of these calculations np.std() performs by default and how to get it to generate the other."

It's worth noting that we're dealing with what Professor Spiegehalter describes on p. 92 of *AoS* as a **metaphorical population**: we have all the data, and we act as if the data-point is taken from a population at random. We can think of this population as an imaginary space of possibilities. \n",

    "So far we've been dealing with the concept of taking a sample from a population to infer the population parameters. One statistic we calculated for a sample was the mean. As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. **The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases (the intuitions behind the CLT are covered in full on p. 236 of *AoS*). For the sampling distribution of the mean, the standard deviation of this distribution is given by\n",

    "This is important because typically we are dealing with samples from populations and all we know about the population is what we see in the sample. From this sample, we want to make inferences about the population. We may do this, for example, by looking at the histogram of the values and by calculating the mean and standard deviation (as estimates of the population parameters), and so we are intrinsically interested in how these quantities vary across samples. \n",

This brings us to a fundamental question: _when we make some inference about a population based on our sample, how confident can we be that we've got it 'right'?_\n",

Instead, let's imagine we live in a town of 50,000 people and we know the height of everyone in this town. We will have 50,000 numbers that tell us everything about our population. We'll simulate these numbers now and put ourselves in one particular town, called 'town 47', where the population mean height is 172 cm and population standard deviation is 5 cm."
